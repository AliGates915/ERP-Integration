ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is basically a centralized software system that helps an organization manage and integrate its core business processes in one place.

Instead of having separate apps for accounting, HR, inventory, sales, purchasing, etc., an ERP system combines them into a single database + unified interface.

## 🔑 Core Modules of ERP

### Finance & Accounting 💰

General Ledger, Accounts Payable/Receivable, Payroll, Budgeting, Reporting.

### Inventory Management 📦

Stock tracking, Warehousing, Reorder levels, Barcode/QR code scanning.

### Sales & CRM 📞

### Procurement (Purchase Management) 🛒

Vendor management, Purchase Orders, Supplier invoices, Payments.

### Human Resources (HRM) 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Employee records, Recruitment, Payroll, Attendance, Leave management.

### Manufacturing / Production 🏭

Bill of Materials, Work Orders, Production scheduling, Quality checks.

### Project Management 📊

Tasks, Milestones, Resource allocation, Cost control.

### Reporting & Analytics 📈

Dashboards, KPIs, Business Intelligence, Custom reports.

###⚡ Benefits of ERP

Centralized Database → One source of truth across all departments.

Automation → Reduces manual work (e.g., auto stock update after sales).

Integration → Links finance, HR, inventory, sales, etc. seamlessly.

Real-time Insights → Dashboards help management make quick decisions.

Scalability → Supports business growth with multi-branch, multi-location setups.

## 🔥 Example Flow in ERP

Sales Order is created → stock is automatically reserved in Inventory.

Once order is fulfilled → Invoice is generated in Finance.

If stock is low → Purchase Order is created in Procurement.

Employee who managed the sale gets commission calculated in HR/Payroll.

All of this is tracked in one ERP system.
